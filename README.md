# Revit-Python-Micro-def
Micro snippets and def()'s of Dynamo Revit Python routines available to share with attribution and improvements shard back to this repository.

def()'s should focus on single-use tasks with ##Comments that can be easily adapted.

Full routines will go in a MACRO-def repository later
